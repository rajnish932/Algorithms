 /*
 Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.If value of the search key is less then the item
 in middle of the interval ,narrow the interval to lower half.
 OtherWise narrow to upper half. Repeated check until the value is found or interval is empty
 Time Complexity :  O(logn)
 
 T(n) = T(n/2)+C;
 
 The above recurrence can be solved either using Recurrence T ree method or Master method. It falls in case II of Master Method and solution of the recurrence is Theta(Logn).

Auxiliary Space: O(1) in case of iterative implementation. In case of recursive implementation, O(Logn) recursion call stack space.
